- 👋 Hi, I’m @mnmercer98, but you may call me Maria or Mrs.Mercer. I am a 25 Year old aspiring Front End Developer currently residing and working out of the Ozark Mountain parts of Arkansas USA. I have hopes that through my codeing I will help promote aspiritations for technical knowledge and digital literacy. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Entry Level Front End Projects and Self Guided-Learning in other adventures(and projects)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Always for free through freecodecamp.org since I first discovered an interest in coding my junior year of highschool when I decided to finish out the year with a business completer. I hold certifications in Word, Access, Powerpoint and took Introduction to Business in highschool during junior year. Last year, I  decided to through a local Community College to obtain a technical certificate in Information Science Technology. I have learned basics of networking, servers(w/ windows hypervisor and Linux os), Linux os in the previous semesters. This fall of 2024, I am taking digital literacy and a course on A+. By taking the free available courses like cs50 through Harvard University this semester  and other continued studies, I hope to learn about other things like back end or various languages for a bit of diversity and more interactive like js, python, ect.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... entry level front projects(currently more familiar with HTML, CSS, and other things like c) Iquire by email for assistance in projects.
